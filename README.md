# Artificial-Intelligence
* Computer science defines AI research as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.

* A typical AI analyzes its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success, Goals can be explicitly defined or induced.

* AI often revolves around the use of algorithms. An algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a mechanical computer can execute.

* Many AI algorithms are capable of learning from data; they can enhance themselves by learning new heuristics (strategies that have worked well in the past), or can themselves write other algorithms.
